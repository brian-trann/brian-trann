My name is Brian, and I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Broker Public Portal. I work on both backend and frontend development (though mainly the performance side for the frontendâ€”I still need to look up how to center a div on MDN Web Docs).

I also enjoy creating interactive electronics projects with Arduinos and microcontrollers for that event in the desert.
